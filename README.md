    <h3 align="center">J.A.T.E Text Editor</h3>
    <p align="center">
        The motivation fo this project is to create a text editor that runs in the browser but also one that will also function online. Nowadays, while we have access to the internet almost everywhere to retrieve necessary data and notes, there are times when we lack internet connection. I built this project because I want to be able to and also help other save notes on a platform that is online but also accessible offline. Not only that, but a single page application that allows users to install as an app on their device with saved dat. This platform is a solution for individuals who is looking to find a way to take notes and save their notes both online and offline easily. You can access this note taker anywhere with the information you need. Through this project, I learned how to build a single page application that meets the PWA criteria. I also familiarized myself with manifest.json and service worker. Lastly, I learned more about client folders, the dist folders, indexedDB, and how concurrently works.

## About the Project

This project is a text editor. The parts I have added to the text editor involves work using webpack, IndexedDB, and various loaders and plugins. The main functionality of the app is the ability to take notes and come back to it later on and have it be accessible. Another component of this app is that you can also download the app to your local device to use. There are data persistence techniques so that it works by multiple browsers and offline.

## Installation

To use this app, you can access it via Heroku: 

If you want to clone this repository to make changes in your local copy, you can use the following commands: 


```
npm init -y
npm install
```

Once those are installed, you can go ahead and run this command to start the system

```
npm run build
```

This command will create a dist folder in the client folder that bundles all the information up. Afterwards you can run 

```
npm run start
``` 

to start the app on a localhost server to test the application out.

## Usage

In this project, a text editor is created to build a platform where users can take notes and access them online and offline. Users can also install the app to use it offline and have an app installed on their local machine with the notes they have taken.
